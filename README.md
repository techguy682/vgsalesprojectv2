Once the Jupyter Notebook loads, click the Voila button on the toolbar.

If it doesn't show up, there are two things to try:
  1. On the toolbar, click Kernel > Restart and Run All. Wait for all processes to finish. Try to click Voila again.
  2. Check your browser settings to allow pop-ups on the website. The website's title should look something like          'hub.gke.mybinder.org'. Reload the page and try to click Voila again.
